- Time management
  - Better find a balance among tasks
  - Dont put most of your time on a task only
  - Know your goal
  - Know what is imminent
- Do not provoke anybody you dont know (John Wick)
  - You never know if he is/was a hitman
- Teaching is an art
  - How to catch students' attention
  - Posture
  - Repeatedly saying keywords
  - Ask questions if necessary
  - Show tricks
  - Time management, again
  - You have a brilliant plan
  - Balance depth and breadth

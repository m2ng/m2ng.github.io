This is the first technical workshop I have ever initiated and conducted for laymen in my life.

In the very first month I joined this company, I had a chat with my line manager about the overall data literacy here. She doesn't feel quite right with it. I then asked: why don't we make a workshop for them?

Luckily her boss is fine with the idea. We could finally prepare for the workshop. There were so many challenges in the past two months, from setting up necessary data infrastructure to preparing workshop tutorials.  I was so anxious about the number of participants and whether the participants would actually be interested in the things I introduce in the workshop.

It turns out that the participants are positive about the service we are building for them. They also like my teaching style. There is certainly room for improvement but in general the result is satisfactory, given that we never had any experience making workshops before.

Doesn't this seem unnatural for what a Data Engineer should do? Data Engineers are people wrangling with data and preparing data assets consumable by other data analysts/business users. They are usually stereotyped as technical guys who cannot speak human. If my title is Data Scientist, probably everything makes a little bit more sense.

Perhaps I am someone who doesn't like to be defined by a role. I want to shape my own role. If I am an artist who makes a living by crafting pretty 3D artwork, I don't have to be someone who makes fancier artwork. Instead, I can be an artist who sings as well. ðŸ™‚

Generally I enjoyed what I did to make this workshop possible. I love talking to people. This first step is a small but really important one. This workshop signifies the beginning of an exciting journey of altering the data landscape of a big corporation. Let's see how far we can go.

Special thanks must be given to Shirley Kwan, who is my line manager and a really encouraging leader. I want to thank Elton Ho, Marco Ho, Connie Yu and many other people including the workshop participants for their great support. The workshop would not be possible without them.
